# Fin-Doc-Thermometer

## Brief Introduction
This project has built a real-time monitoring system to track visits to electronic financial documents available in The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA). The system consists of a streaming pipeline and a batch pipeline. The streaming pipeline deals with real-time data, tracking what companies attract people's most attention and the total of documents that have been visited by second. The batch pipeline generates statistics from historical data to help describe how active the public are in checking documents. 

## Pipeline
The whole system is illustrated as follows:
